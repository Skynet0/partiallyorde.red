    <h2>Letters of Recommendation</h2>

    <p>
      If you're reading this page, it's because you've asked me (or are thinking of asking me) to write
      you a letter of recommendation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm happy to provide letters where they can be helpful, but I also want to be transparent about
      what kinds of letters I'm able to provide, and where I'm comfortable submitting them. Different
      applications have different expecations of letters. Writing a strong letter takes a
      significant amount of time and effort on my part, but not all letters need to be strong.
    </p>

    <h3>Short Letters</h3>
    <p>Some examples of programs that I am fine writing short letters for include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SURFs, or other summer research programs</li>
      <li>Study abroad</li>
      <li>Coursework-based masters programs</li>
      <li>The "third letter" for graduate programs with two other very strong letters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These sorts of letters tend to consist of "X took my course and earned [insert grade here]",
      potentially with some descriptions of our interactions. Again, these are not strong letters,
      but they may be sufficient for your application.
    </p>

    <p>
      To request a letter from me, make sure to ask me in-person or over email first. Once I've
      agreed to write you a letter (and directed you to this page), send me the following information
      <strong>at least <em>two</em> weeks before your earliest deadline</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your preferred name and pronouns</li>
      <li>Your latest resume/CV</li>
      <li>
        A copy of your (unofficial) transcript.
        <ul>
          <li>Please acknowledge that you waive your FERPA rights so that I can discuss your grade(s) in the letter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A list of the programs that you're applying for, and for each:
        <ul>
          <li>The deadline for my letter</li>
          <li>A short description of why you're applying for it (this could be a summary of your statement of purpose or similar)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>At least 2 distinct interactions, moments, projects, or similar (aside from your final grade)</strong> that
        would make good things to talk about in the letter (e.g. class participation, conversations/discussions with me,
        going above-and-beyond on projects, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you submit your letter requests, make sure to waive your right to view submitted letters.
    </p>

    <h3>Strong Letters</h3>
    <p>
      Some examples of applications that I will need to know you better for include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competitive research-based masters programs</li>
      <li>PhD applications</li>
      <li>Graduate fellowships, scholarships, and similar awards</li>
      <li>Jobs in academia</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The students that I can most effectively write a strong letter for include those who
      have been a teaching assistant or have done research with me in <strong>at least two distinct quarters</strong>.
      I may also be able to write these letters if we've had extensive interactions both in and
      outside of class, and you've gone above and beyond the course requirements; but they won't be
      as strong as for students with whom I have a strong working relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><strong>If you're not sure what letter you need, or whether I can write you a strong letter, please ask.</strong></em>
    </p>

    <p>
      To request this kind of letter from me, make sure to ask me in-person or over email first. Once I've
      agreed to write you a strong letter (and directed you to this page), send me the following information
      <strong>at least <em>two</em> weeks before your earliest deadline</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Everything in the list above for short letters</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>At least 3 more distinct interactions, moments, projects, or similar</strong> that would make good things to talk
        about in the letter. These should cover the different ways in which we've interacted (student, TA, research, etc.), and I should be
        able to write about a paragraph about each individual thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Draft of the materials you're submitting for the application (e.g. full statement of
        purpose/research, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
